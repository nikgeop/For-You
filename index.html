                        From all for our moments, good and bad, you've helped me learn so much about myself. And I am so happy that you've given 
                        me that opportunity to grow, together, with you. And I want to keep growing with you baby. From this valentines day, to the 
                        next, and for every valentines day I want you to know how much i appreciate you. And for every day in between for that matter! I also feel like i've grown as an individual
                        sooo much through our relationship, and you have taught me and inspired me to be a better person. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You know how I say that one shroom trip fundementally
                        changed me as a person? well, aside from that there has only been one other thing that has had more of an impact on the kind 
                        of person I am, and that's you. You taught be to be kinder, more open minded, and love myself more, slowly but surely.

                        I can't wait for what the future holds for us. I cant wait to move in with you, see you walk
                        down the aisle and kissing you at the altar, having kids, growing old together, and all the quiet moments of us together. You
                        really are the only, and I mean the only person I want to spend the rest of my life with. I cant express it with words.
                        I hope the amount of time "studying" this website is just a testament to how much I mean every word of this.

                        person you are, there is truly nobody like you. Keep doing what you are doing my love. Never change for nobody queen

                        Below I made a little timeline of moments that I think both of us can reminicise on a bit. <br>
                        The music playing is also a collection of songs that I think we can both appreciate, especially the last one,
                        even though it's not a love song per say...
